# [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example :
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.


Example 1:
```java
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Example 2:
```java
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]

Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

```
