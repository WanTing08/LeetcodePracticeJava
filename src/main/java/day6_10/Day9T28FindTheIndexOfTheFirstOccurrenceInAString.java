    Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack,
    or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

    Example 1:
    Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
    The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
