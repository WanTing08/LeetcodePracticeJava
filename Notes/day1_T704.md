# [704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/)



### Solution

**Double Pointers.** To begin, we establish two pointers that denote 
the position of the first and last elements of the interval in which
we are seeking the target. We then use a recursive approach to determine 
if the middle element of the interval matches the target value. 
If it does, we return the index of the middle element. 
If the target is greater than the middle element, 
we search for the target in the interval to the right of the 
middle element: [mid, right]. 
Conversely, if the target is smaller than the middle element, 
we search for the target in the interval to the left of the 
middle element: [left, mid]. 
Finally, if we do not find the target in the interval (i.e., left > right), 
we return -1 to indicate that it is not present.

Time Complexity: O(log(n))

### Summary

1 `mid = (right + left) / 2` 

The while loop should contain the position of "mid".
